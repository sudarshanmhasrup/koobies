### ðŸ’œ About this project

Learning Kotlin opens many career opportunities for developers. You can build native and cross-platform mobile apps,
desktop apps, backend services, AI agents, and many more, all with Kotlin. But the adoption rate of Kotlin outside the
Android development space is still very low compared to other technologies. The core reasons are the lack of good and
beginner-friendly learning resources and fewer internship and job opportunities, though it may change over time as the
adoption rate grows.

To solve this problem, I decided to build this platform. Itâ€™s an open-source, community-driven platform built with
Kotlin Multiplatform that helps Kotlin developers find internships and job opportunities requiring Kotlin knowledge,
upskill through community-curated courses, and learn by building projects.

### Technologies Used

<!-- Rehase later -->

1) [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/): The platform is built using Kotlin
   Multiplatform, allowing it to run on multiple platforms like Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web from a single codebase.
2) [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/): The UI is built using Compose
   Multiplatform, providing a modern and declarative way to create user interfaces across different platforms. Compose
   Multiplatform is powering the UI for Android, iOS and Desktop versions of the platform.
3) [Ktor](https://ktor.io/): The backend of the platform is built using Ktor, a Kotlin framework for building
   asynchronous servers and clients. It provides a robust and scalable backend to handle user requests and data storage.

### Thank you! ðŸ™Œ

Thank you so much for checking out this repository. I understand the challenges one faces when learning Kotlin, and Iâ€™ve
been there too. This is the core motivation behind this project. I created it to participate in the Kotlin Conf 2026
challenge, but I believe it has the potential to grow beyond just another contest project. If you love the project,
please consider starring this repository.
