### About this project

Learning Kotlin opens many career opportunities for developers. You can build native and cross-platform mobile apps,
desktop apps, backend services, AI agents, and many more, all with Kotlin. But the adoption rate of Kotlin outside the
Android development space is still very low compared to other technologies. The core reasons are the lack of good and
beginner-friendly learning resources and fewer internship and job opportunities, though it may change over time as the
adoption rate grows.

To solve this problem, I decided to build this platform. Itâ€™s an open-source, community-driven platform built with
Kotlin Multiplatform that helps Kotlin developers find internships and job opportunities requiring Kotlin knowledge,
upskill through community-curated courses, and learn by building projects.
